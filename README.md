### Important underlying concepts in ML

- *Regression* vs *Classification*
	- Regression - when theres an range of labels with infinite values
	- Classification - when the labels are discrete and limited
- *Features* vs *Labels*
- *Test* vs *Training* sets of data
- Feature *normalization*
- Feature *selection*

#### Moving from Lodash to Tensorflow **WHY?**

- Using Lodash is extremely slow and not *Numbers* focused. Also, some things are harder to do in Lodash.
- Tensorflow JS has an API similar to Lodash.
- It is extremely fast for numeric calculations.

#### **Best way to learn Tensorflow JS**

- Learn some fundamentals around Tensorflow.
- Go through some exercises on Tensorflow.
- Implement already implemented algorithms in Tensorflow for practice.
- Try to build other algorithms with Tensorflow.
