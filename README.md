# Tensorflow JS Notes

- Using Lodash is extremely slow and not *Numbers* focused. Also, some things are harder to do in Lodash.
- Tensorflow JS has an API similar to Lodash.
- It is extremely fast for numeric calculations.

#### **Best way to learn Tensorflow JS**

- Learn some fundamentals around Tensorflow.
- Go through some exercises on Tensorflow.
- Implement already implemented algorithms in Tensorflow for practice.
- Try to build other algorithms with Tensorflow.
